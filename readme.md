# Edgar.Godot
Edgar.Godot is a set of gdscript tools designed to create ready-to-use json data resources by utilizing *.tmj, *.tmx files, as well as custom *.edgar-graph files. With the generated *.edgar-graph (json) files and the Edgar engine, you can easily combine them to generate Rogue maps. This library depends on YATI and Edgar, and the Edgar engine is not included in the source. If you need a non-C# (Dotnet) version of the Edgar engine, please check my github repository: Edgar.GDExtension.
