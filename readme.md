# Edgar.Godot

Edgar.Godot is a set of gdscript tools designed to create ready-to-use json data resources by utilizing `*.tmj`, `*.tmx` files, as well as custom `*.edgar-graph` files.  
With the generated `*.edgar-graph` (json) files and the Edgar engine, you can easily combine them to generate Rogue maps.  
> This library depends on `YATI` and `Edgar`.  
> **Currently, the source of `Edgar.Aot` is used in this repo.**  
> If you need a non-C# (Dotnet) version of the Edgar engine, please check my github repository: Edgar.GDExtension.
